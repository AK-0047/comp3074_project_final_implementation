# Project Name: RouteShare

RouteShare is a modern, user-friendly mobile application designed to revolutionize the way people carpool. Built with React Native, this app offers a simple and efficient platform for users to post trips, search for rides, and view available carpooling options. The app aims to promote affordable, sustainable, and eco-friendly travel solutions. Users can quickly post ride requests by entering key trip details such as origin, destination, date, and available seats. The app uses the OpenCage API to provide smart city autocomplete suggestions, ensuring users can easily select their starting and ending locations. Key features include trip listing, user authentication, and a clean, visually appealing interface with intuitive navigation. RouteShare focuses on creating a smooth user experience while promoting environmental sustainability and community-driven travel. Future enhancements include adding payment integration, trip reviews, and AI-based carpooling recommendations.
